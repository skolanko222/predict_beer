# predict_beer

Project that I have collaborated on with my colleauges for the Python in the Enterprice course.

We've built Django application that predicts average rating of a beer using Machine Learning. 
The algorithm is trained on dataset of 5000 beers from all around the world. User can describe a beer by a number of values - algorithm 
returns average raiting of described beverage.
